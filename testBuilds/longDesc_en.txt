 This package installs i-net Clear Reports server in 2 steps.
 ================================================
 First, the program files are copied to /usr/share/i-net-clear-reports.
 Then the installer will automatically attempt to open the browser to configure
 the server (i.e. set up the proxy, etc.). Depending on your environment
 and package installer, this may not work - if the browser does not automatically open up,
 please check the file /usr/share/i-net-clear-reports/webconfig.txt and enter
 the UUID there in the server web configuration page at http://localhost:9000/setup
 (note that if a different port than 9000 is specified in the webconfig.txt, use this one).
 Note: This package doesn't work with all graphical package managers. We recommend to use
 the command-line tools for installation instead.
