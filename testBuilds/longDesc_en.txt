This package installs i-net HelpDesk in 2 steps.
 
First, the program files are copied to /usr/share/i-net HelpDesk.
Then the installer will automatically attempt to open the browser to configure
the server (i.e. set up the database, the proxy, etc.). Depending on your environment
and package installer, this may not work - if the browser does not automatically open up,
please check the file /usr/share/i-net HelpDesk/Server/webconfig.txt and enter
the UUID there in the server web configuration page at http://localhost:8002/setup
(note that if a different port than 8002 is specified in the webconfig.txt, use this one).
